# Predicting Stock Prices

Attempting to predict stock market prices with machine learning algorithms. The two approaches in the project were by recurrent neural networks with LSTM and by the Facebook's Prophet tool.

The algorithm with the recurrent neural network is presented in the Neural Network to Predict Stock Markets Jupyter notebook while the one using Prophet is presented in the Neural Network to Predict Stock Markets notebook.
